description: Show only failed bash commands from history
allowed-tools: Bash(claude-hook-advisor:*)
---

!claude-hook-advisor --history --failures --limit 20

The output above shows all commands that failed. Let me analyze these failures and:
1. Identify patterns in the errors
2. Suggest fixes for the failed commands
3. Explain why each command might have failed

What would you like me to help with regarding these failures?
