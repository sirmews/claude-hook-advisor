# Hook Enhancement Ideas

This document outlines advanced hook features and enhancements that could significantly improve the claude-hook-advisor experience by leveraging more of the Claude Code hook system's capabilities.

## Current Implementation Status

Currently implemented (v0.2.0):
- **PreToolUse**: Command mapping and replacement (`src/hooks.rs:44-104`)
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Directory reference detection (`src/hooks.rs:106-141`) 
- **PostToolUse**: Basic command execution tracking (`src/hooks.rs:143-180`)

## Available Hook Events (Not Yet Used)

From Claude Code hook system research:
1. **SessionStart**: Initializes session context
2. **AgentStop**: Triggered when main agent finishes responding
3. **SubAgentStop**: Runs when subagents complete tasks
4. **SessionEnd**: Performs cleanup and logging
5. **Notification**: Handles permission requests and idle state

## Priority 1: Session Management Hooks

### SessionStart Hook - Project Context & Environment Setup

**Purpose**: Automatically configure claude-hook-advisor based on project detection and user patterns.

**Implementation Location**: New function in `src/hooks.rs`

```rust
fn handle_session_start(config: &Config, hook_input: &HookInput) -> Result<()> {
    // Auto-detect project type (package.json → Node.js, Cargo.toml → Rust, etc.)
    // Suggest optimal tool mappings based on project type
    // Set up project-specific directory aliases dynamically
    // Initialize session-specific analytics tracking
    // Validate development environment prerequisites
}
```

**Configuration Enhancement**:
```toml
[session]
auto_detect_project = true
auto_suggest_mappings = true
project_type_detection = [
    { pattern = "package.json", type = "nodejs", suggest = { npm = "bun", yarn = "bun", npx = "bunx" } },
    { pattern = "Cargo.toml", type = "rust", suggest = { cargo = "cargo" } },
    { pattern = "requirements.txt", type = "python", suggest = { pip = "uv" } }
]
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic project-type detection reduces manual configuration
- Dynamic directory alias creation based on project structure
- Session-scoped analytics initialization
- Environment validation prevents common setup issues

### SessionEnd Hook - Analytics & Cleanup

**Purpose**: Collect session analytics and perform cleanup operations.

```rust
fn handle_session_end(config: &Config, hook_input: &HookInput) -> Result<()> {
    // Save session analytics to persistent storage
    // Generate usage reports and suggestions
    // Clean up temporary files or state
    // Update confidence scores based on session success
}
```

## Priority 2: Workflow Automation Hooks

### AgentStop Hook - Automated Quality Assurance

**Purpose**: Run automated checks and suggest follow-up actions after Claude completes major operations.

```rust
fn handle_agent_stop(config: &Config, hook_input: &HookInput) -> Result<()> {
    // Auto-run linting/formatting after code changes detected
    // Suggest follow-up actions based on what was accomplished
    // Update project documentation automatically
    // Trigger git operations if configured (add, commit suggestions)
    // Run relevant tests if code was modified
}
```

**Configuration Enhancement**:
```toml
[workflow_automation]
auto_lint = true
auto_format = true
suggest_git_operations = true
run_tests_after_changes = true

[quality_gates]
lint_commands = ["cargo clippy", "npm run lint"]
format_commands = ["cargo fmt", "npm run fmt"]
test_commands = ["cargo test", "npm test"]
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic code quality enforcement
- Intelligent workflow suggestions
- Reduced manual follow-up tasks
- Consistent development practices

### SubAgentStop Hook - Task Completion Intelligence

**Purpose**: Track subtask completion and suggest related optimizations.

```rust
fn handle_sub_agent_stop(config: &Config, hook_input: &HookInput) -> Result<()> {
    // Track which subtasks were completed successfully
    // Learn patterns of successful task sequences
    // Suggest related tasks that commonly follow
    // Update directory aliases based on files accessed
}
```

## Priority 3: Enhanced Analytics & Intelligence

### Enhanced PostToolUse Hook - Advanced Command Intelligence

**Current**: Basic execution logging (`src/hooks.rs:175`)

**Enhanced**: Intelligent pattern recognition and adaptive suggestions

```rust
fn handle_post_tool_use_enhanced(config: &Config, hook_input: &HookInput) -> Result<()> {
    // Track command success/failure patterns by context
    // Measure timing and performance metrics
    // Implement adaptive suggestion confidence scoring
    // Learn usage patterns for better future suggestions
    // Detect command sequences and suggest automation
}
```

**New Analytics Structure**:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CommandAnalytics {
    pub command_pattern: String,
    pub success_rate: f32,
    pub average_execution_time: Duration,
    pub context_tags: Vec<String>, // project type, directory, etc.
    pub confidence_score: f32,
    pub usage_frequency: u32,
    pub last_used: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Context-aware command suggestions
- Performance-based recommendation scoring
- Automatic workflow pattern detection
- Personalized optimization suggestions

## Priority 4: Security & Permissions

### Notification Hook - Enhanced Security Validation

**Purpose**: Provide advanced security checks and custom permission policies.

```rust
fn handle_notification(config: &Config, hook_input: &HookInput) -> Result<()> {
    // Enhanced security validation for sensitive operations
    // Custom permission policies based on file patterns
    // Sensitive file protection (prevent accidental commits of secrets)
    // External service integration warnings
    // Rate limiting for potentially dangerous operations
}
```

**Security Configuration**:
```toml
[security]
protected_files = [".env", "*.key", "*.pem", "config/secrets.yml"]
dangerous_commands = ["rm -rf", "sudo", "curl | sh"]
require_confirmation = ["git push --force", "cargo publish"]

[external_integrations]
warn_on_network_commands = true
block_suspicious_urls = true
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Context-Aware Command Mapping

**Enhancement**: Move beyond static mappings to intelligent, context-sensitive suggestions.

**Current**: Regex-based word boundary matching (`src/hooks.rs:213`)

**Enhanced**: 
- Project-type specific mappings
- Directory-based command variations
- Historical success rate weighting
- Multi-command workflow suggestions

### 2. Dynamic Directory Aliasing

**Enhancement**: Learn and suggest new directory aliases based on usage patterns.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct DynamicAlias {
    pub suggested_alias: String,
    pub canonical_path: String,
    pub usage_frequency: u32,
    pub confidence_score: f32,
    pub suggested_reason: String, // "frequently accessed", "project pattern", etc.
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Configuration Management

**Enhancement**: Self-updating configuration based on learned patterns.

- Automatic addition of successful command mappings
- Confidence-based configuration suggestions
- Project-specific configuration inheritance
- Team-wide configuration sharing capabilities

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (v0.3.0)
1. Add SessionStart/SessionEnd hooks
2. Implement project type detection
3. Create enhanced analytics data structures
4. Add basic workflow automation

### Phase 2: Intelligence (v0.4.0)
1. Implement adaptive confidence scoring
2. Add context-aware command suggestions
3. Create dynamic directory aliasing
4. Enhance security validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation (v0.5.0)
1. Full workflow automation
2. Team collaboration features
3. Advanced pattern recognition
4. Machine learning integration for suggestions

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Use cached regex patterns (already implemented: `src/hooks.rs:14`)
- Implement lazy loading for analytics data
- Consider async processing for non-blocking operations

### Storage
- Add persistent analytics storage (JSON/SQLite)
- Implement configuration versioning
- Create backup/restore mechanisms

### Testing
- Add integration tests for each hook type
- Create mock hook input generators
- Implement performance benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Prioritize**: Decide which features provide the most value
2. **Prototype SessionStart**: Begin with project detection and dynamic aliases
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: Upgrade PostToolUse with intelligence features
4. **User Feedback**: Test with real workflows and iterate
