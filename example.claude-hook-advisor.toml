# Claude Hook Advisor Configuration Example
# This file shows various command mapping examples for different use cases
#
# ===== IMPORTANT: How Command Matching Works =====
# Commands are matched ONLY at the start of the line (primary command position).
# This ensures mappings apply to the main command, not subcommands or arguments.
#
# Examples:
#   ✅ "npm install"    → matches "npm" → becomes "bun install"
#   ✅ "npm start"      → matches "npm" → becomes "bun start"
#   ❌ "npx npm"        → does NOT match "npm" (not primary command)
#   ❌ "npm-check"      → does NOT match "npm" (different command)
#   ❌ "git rm file"    → does NOT match "rm" (rm is a subcommand)
#
# This prevents unintended replacements and keeps your command mappings predictable.

[commands]
# ===== Node.js / JavaScript Development =====
# Prefer Bun over npm/yarn for faster package management
npm = "bun"
yarn = "bun"
pnpm = "bun"
npx = "bunx"

# ===== Python Development =====
# Use uv for faster Python package management
pip = "uv pip"
"pip install" = "uv add"
"pip uninstall" = "uv remove"
python = "uv run python"

# ===== Modern CLI Tool Replacements =====
# Replace traditional tools with modern alternatives
cat = "bat"                    # Syntax highlighting
ls = "eza"                     # Better file listing
find = "fd"                    # Faster file search
grep = "rg"                    # Faster text search (ripgrep)
curl = "wget --verbose"        # Alternative HTTP client
wget = "curl -L"               # Alternative download tool

# ===== Git Shortcuts =====
# Encourage better git practices
"git push" = "git push --set-upstream origin HEAD"
"git commit" = "git commit -S"  # Always sign commits

# ===== Docker Alternatives =====
# Use Podman instead of Docker
docker = "podman"
"docker-compose" = "podman-compose"

# ===== Build Tools =====
# Prefer modern build tools
make = "just"                  # Modern command runner
cmake = "meson"               # Modern build system

# ===== Text Editors =====
# Encourage modern editors
vim = "nvim"                  # Neovim instead of vim
nano = "micro"                # Modern terminal editor

# ===== System Monitoring =====
# Modern system tools
top = "htop"                  # Better process viewer
ps = "procs"                  # Modern process viewer
du = "dust"                   # Better disk usage

# ===== Network Tools =====
# Modern networking tools
ping = "gping"                # Graphical ping
netstat = "ss"                # Modern socket statistics

# ===== File Operations =====
# Safer file operations
# NOTE: "rm" mapping only affects direct "rm" commands, not "git rm" or other subcommands
rm = "trash"                  # Move to trash instead of permanent delete
cp = "cp -i"                  # Interactive copy (ask before overwrite)
mv = "mv -i"                  # Interactive move (ask before overwrite)

# ===== Package Managers by OS =====
# Encourage consistent package managers
apt = "nala"                  # Better apt frontend
yum = "dnf"                   # Modern Red Hat package manager
brew = "brew"                 # Keep Homebrew as-is (already good)

# ===== Development Servers =====
# Use modern development servers
"python -m http.server" = "python -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1"  # Bind to localhost only
"php -S" = "php -S 127.0.0.1:8000"  # Secure PHP dev server

# ===== Security Tools =====
# Encourage secure practices
ssh = "ssh -o VerifyHostKeyDNS=yes"  # Verify host keys via DNS
scp = "rsync -avz --progress"        # Use rsync instead of scp

# ===== Custom Project Commands =====
# Project-specific shortcuts (examples)
"npm start" = "bun dev"              # Use bun for dev server
"npm test" = "bun test --watch"      # Watch mode for tests
"npm run build" = "bun run build:prod"  # Production build

# ===== Dangerous Command Replacements =====
# Prevent accidental damage
"rm -rf" = "echo 'Use trash command instead of rm -rf for safety'"
"sudo rm" = "echo 'Consider using trash or be very careful with sudo rm'"
"chmod 777" = "echo 'chmod 777 is dangerous, consider more restrictive permissions'"

# ===== Environment-Specific =====
# Different tools for different environments
"kubectl" = "k9s"                   # Better Kubernetes interface
"terraform" = "tofu"                # OpenTofu instead of Terraform
"aws" = "aws --cli-auto-prompt"     # AWS CLI with auto-prompt
